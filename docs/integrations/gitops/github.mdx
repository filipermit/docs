## Configure your git repository

Please follow the below steps to make your Permit policy stored at your git repository.

### Create a repository

You need a repository with a default branch that exists on the remote ( with an initial commit ).
If you already have a repository you can skip to [next step](#give-permit-permissions-to-your-repository).

Create your repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/new):

### Give Permit permissions to your repository

In order for us to be able to generate and push policies to your repository, you need to create an SSH key,
and add it as a "Deploy Key" with write access to your repo.

#### Generate an SSH key

You can use this command to generate a secured SSH key:
```
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "help@permit.io"
```

You will be prompted to enter a location for the private and public keys ( your private key will be securely stored on our end, no passphrase will be required )

The private key is at the location you chose and the public key is at the same location with a ".pub" suffix.

#### Add the Deploy Key

1. To add a "Deploy Key", go to your repository &rarr; Settings &rarr; Deploy Keys and press on "Add deploy key" button.

2. Copy the public SSH key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) to your clipboard and paste it in the GitHub prompt.

    **It is required to toggle the "Allow write access"**

## Configure Permit to use your repository

### Make Permit use the repository

1. Login to [Permit.io](https://app.permit.io).
2. Navigate to your project. with the project selector at sidebar.
3. Navigate to (API Keys)[https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys] page.
4. Create a Project or Organization API Key. (you will need it for the 8th step)
5. Copy the SSH url from GitHub:
    _![Copy SSH url](/img/integrations/gitops/github-copy-ssh-url.png)_
6. Copy the SSH private key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) and replace new lines with "\n".
    You can do the new line replacement using the following command:
    ```shell
    awk -v ORS='\\n' '1' <private-key-file>
    ```
7. Paste your values into that json and store at in a file:
    ```json
    {
      "url": "<your-ssh-url>",
      "main_branch_name":"<your-default-branch>",
      "credentials": {
        "auth_type": "ssh",
        "username":"git",
        "private_key":"<your-private-key>"
      },
      "key": "<unique-key-your-repo>"
    }
    ```
8. Replace the placeholder with your project id or key and execute a POST request to Permit with your json:
    ```shell
    curl -X POST "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY from step 5}" --data-binary "@path/to/your/json"
    ```
9. Go back to your GitHub repository, you should see new branches, one for each environment in your project.
10. After validating your new branches policy, you need to activate the new repository in permit,
to do this, replace the placeholder with your project id or key and execute a PUT request to Permit:
    ```shell
    curl -X PUT "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos/<your-repo-id-or-key>/activate" -H "Authorization: <your-permit-api-key>"
    ```
9. Your git repository is now used for your PDPs policy ðŸš€
