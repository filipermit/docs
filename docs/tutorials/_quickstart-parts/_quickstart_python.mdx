## Add the SDK to your Python code

Initialise the **Python SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK

```
pip install permit
```

2. Import the SDK into your code

```python
from permit import Permit
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK.
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```python
# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up.
permit = Permit(
    # your secret API KEY
    token="<your-api-key>",

    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    # this is the address where you can find the PDP container.
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
)
```

## Check for permissions using the SDK

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`, passing in 3 arguments:

- `user`: a unique string id that identifies the user doing the action. This is typically the user key.
- `action`: the action performed.
- `resource`: the resource (object) the action is performed on.

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@smith.com` can `create` a `document` resource.

```python
permitted = await permit.check("john@smith.com", "create", "document")

if permitted:
    print("John is permitted to create a document")
else:
    print("John is NOT PERMITTED to create document!")
```

:::info
Usually instead of an email you'd use the unique identifier provided by your chosen authentication solution.
You can also pass the entire decoded JWT, to include attributes about the user.
:::

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `permit.check()` can pass the **tenant** as part of the **resource**.

The tenant passed in needs to be either the **tenant id** or the **tenant key**.

You can use the **[list_tenants API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/list_tenants)** to **get the ids and keys set for your tenants**.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant key that you have defined within Permit.

:::

For example, if we want to check if `john@permit.io` can read documents that belong to the `awesome_inc` tenant:

```python
permitted = await permit.check(
    # the key of the user
    "john@permit.io",
    # the action
    "read",
    # the resource (all resources of type document under the awesome_inc tenant)
    { type: "document", tenant: "awesome_inc" }
)
```

## Check permissions against ABAC policies

Above we have checked for permissions against an RBAC policy - but what if we have an **ABAC policy** we want to run a permission check for?
An ABAC policy is made up of **User Sets** and **Resource Sets**, which you can read more about [here](/features/policy-editor/editor-overview#what-makes-up-an-abac-policy).

With ABAC we define conditions based on **pre-configured attributes**.

If we are running a `permit.check()` for an ABAC policy, we can attach **just-in-time attributes** to the `user` and the `resource`.
There attributes are merged (and override) user and resource attributes that were persisted to the permit API.

```python
permitted = await permit.check(
	# the user object
	{
        # the user key
		"key": "check@permit.io",
        # just-in-time attributes on the user
		"attributes": {
			"location": "England",
			"department": "Engineering",
		},
	},
	# the action the user is trying to do
	"action",
	# Resource
	{
        # the type of the resource (the resource key)
		"type": "resource",
        # just-in-time attributes on the resource
		"attributes": {
			"hasApproval": "true",
		},
        # the tenant the resource belong to
		"tenant": "tenant",
	}
)
```

:::note REMEMBER

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

<!--
## Write API

Running `permit.write()` will perform API calls against the Permit cloud and will modify
the state of permissions and other objects in the system.

### Sync user (create a user in the permissions system)

Before being able to check permissions with `permit.check()` -
Permit must be able to identify the user and attach permissions and roles to that user.
In order to declare a new user in the system, use `permit.api.sync_user()`:

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com", # can be any unique string
    "firstName": "John", # optional
    "lastName": "Smith", # optional
    "email": "john@smith.com", # optional
}
await permit.write(permit.api.sync_user(user))
```


### Sync user with initial roles

If you want to **attach** a role to a user in the same API call you can define _initial_ roles by adding a **role key**.
Each item in the _initial_ role list will include a role key (the role name) and a tenant key.

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "email": "john@smith.com",
    # John will be assigned the admin role in the default tenant upon creation
    "roles": [{"role":"admin", "tenant": "default"}]
}
await permit.write(permit.api.sync_user(user))
```

:::note
If a user with such key already **exists** in Permit, **we will not override** the user roles and Permit will **ignore** the role key completely.
:::


### Create a tenant

Tenants represent user and resource boundaries in your system. Typically if you are building
a multi tenant SaaS application where you are serving multiple customers from the same software
instances, _tenants_ allow you to create a **boundary** around one customer (i.e: tenant) such that users outside
the tenant cannot access the tenant's associated resources.

Every one of your customers is typically a tenant that contains only that tenant's users.

To create a tenant, use `permit.api.create_tenant()`.

```python
cool_company_tenant = {
    "key": "cool_company_inc",
    "name": "Cool Company Inc"
}

await permit.write(permit.api.create_tenant(cool_company_tenant))
```


### Assign a role

You can assign a role to a user in a given tenant.

```python
await permit.write(
    permit.api.assign_role("john@smith.com", "viewer", "cool_company_inc")
)
```


### Chaining multiple mutations together

You can chain multiple write operations (**_or mutations_**), and `permit.write()`
will run them according to the order you specify.

```python
# runs the mutations in order:
await permit.write(
    # first creates the user "john"
    permit.api.sync_user({
        "key": "john@smith.com",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "email": "john@smith.com",
    }),
    # then, creates the "cool_company_inc" tenant
    permit.api.create_tenant({
        "key": "cool_company_inc",
        "name": "Cool Company Inc"
    }),
    # finally, assigns the role "admin" to user "john" on the tenant "cool_company_inc"
    permit.api.assign_role("john@smith.com", "admin", "cool_company_inc")
)
``` -->

## Full app example

Assuming a Python app made up of a single file, with the `permit` and `FastAPI` modules installed.

Create a new directory for your new python project.

```
mkdir hello-permissions && cd hello-permissions
```

Optionally, create a new virtual environment for your project - you might need to install `pyenv` and `virtualenv`.

```
pyenv virtualenv permissions && pyenv activate permissions
```

Now install the Permit.io SDK. We will also install the `FastAPI` and `Uvicorn` packages in order to run an HTTP server in our example.

```
pip install permit fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
```

Create a file called `test.py`.

```
touch test.py
```

Copy the following code inside `test.py` and replace with your `API KEY` and `user-object`.
You can find instructions on getting a secret API Key in the previous section.

```python
import asyncio

from permit import Permit
from fastapi import FastAPI, status, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
    # your API KEY
    token="[YOUR_API_KEY]",
)

# This user was defined by you in the previous step and
# is already assigned with a role in the permission system.
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john@smith.com",
} # in a real app, you would typically decode the user id from a JWT token

@app.get("/")
async def check_permissions():
    permitted = await permit.check("john@smith.com", "read", "document")
    if not permitted:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail={
            "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is NOT PERMITTED to create document!"
        })

    return JSONResponse(status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK, content={
        "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is PERMITTED to create document!"
    })

```

Now that your application is ready, let's run it!
Go to your applications localhost live deployment to see the outcome of the permission check.

```
uvicorn test:app --reload --port=<YOUR_LOCALHOST_PORT_NUMBER>
```
