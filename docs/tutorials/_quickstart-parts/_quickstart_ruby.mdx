## Add the SDK to your Ruby code

Initialise the **Ruby SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK for Ruby

```bash
gem install permit-sdk
```

2. Import the SDK into your code

```ruby
require 'permit-sdk'
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK. <br/>
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```ruby
require 'permit-sdk'
permit = Permit.new("TOKEN", "localhost:7766") # the PDP url is optional
```

## Check for permissions using the SDK

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`. You need to pass 3 arguments to the function:

- `user`: a unique user that identifies the user doing the action - this can be created using hash or a string.
- `action`: the action performed, as string.
- `resource`: the resource the action is performed on - this can be created using a hash or a string.

In the following examples we are checking that a user with the unique key `john@permit.io` can `create` a `document` resource.

Here is an example using strings:

```ruby
require 'permit-sdk'
permit = Permit.new("TOKEN", "localhost:7766") # the PDP url is optional

permitted = permit.check("john@permit.io", "create" , "document")
if permitted
  puts "john@permit.io is permitted to create a document"
else
  puts "john@permit.io is not permitted to create a document"
end
```

And here is an example using Hash objects:

```ruby
require 'permit-sdk'
permit = Permit.new("TOKEN", "localhost:7766") # the PDP url is optional

user_hash = {"key": "john@permit.io", "first_name": "john", "last_name": "doe", "email": "john@permit.io"}
resource_hash = {"type": "document", "tenant": "default"}
permitted = permit.check(user_hash, "create" , resource_hash)
if permitted
  puts "john@permit.io is permitted to create a document"
else
  puts "john@permit.io is not permitted to create a document"
end
```

:::info
Usually instead of an email you'd use the unique identifier provided by your chosen authentication solution.
You can also pass the entire decoded JWT, to include attributes about the user.
:::

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `Permit.check()` can pass the **tenant** as part of the **resource** like we showed before in the Hash objects example.

The tenant passed in needs to be either the **tenant id** or the **tenant key**.

You can use the **[list_tenants API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/list_tenants)** to **get the ids and keys set for your tenants**.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant key that you have defined within Permit.

:::

```ruby
if permit.check("user", "action", { "key": "resource", "tenant": "tenant" })
  # Allow to close document
end
```

## Check permissions against ABAC policies

Above we have checked for permissions against an RBAC policy - but what if we have an **ABAC policy** we want to run a permission check for?
An ABAC policy is made up of **User Sets** and **Resource Sets**, which you can read more about [here](/features/policy-editor/editor-overview#what-makes-up-an-abac-policy).

With ABAC we define conditions based on **pre-configured attributes**.

If we are running a `permit.check()` for an ABAC policy, we replace the `userId` and the `resource` with objects, containing attributes.

```ruby
if permit.check(user, 'close', { "key": "resource", "attributes": {"hasApproval": "true"} })
  # Allow to close document
end
```

:::note REMEMBER

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

## Full app example

Assuming a Ruby app made up of a single file, with the `permit-sdk` and `webrick` gem packages installed with the following command :

```bash
gem install permit-sdk webrick
```

Here is a full example of a Ruby app that uses the Permit.io SDK to check for permissions:

```ruby
require 'webrick'
require 'permit'

permit = Permit.new("<YOUR_API_KEY>")

server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(Port: 4000)

server.mount_proc '/' do |_, res|
  res['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'

  permitted = permit.check("user@mail.com", "read", "document")
  if permitted
    res.status = 200
    res.body = { result: "user@mail.com is PERMITTED to read document!" }.to_json
    next
  end
  res.status = 403
  res.body = { result: "user@mail.com is NOT PERMITTED to read document" }.to_json
end

trap 'INT' do server.shutdown end

server.start
```
