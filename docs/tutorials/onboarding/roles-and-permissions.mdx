title: Roles & Permissions
---

We have defined our resource and the actions that can be associated with it, now we need to **create some roles**,
and give each role **appropriate permissions** to perform those actions.

:::tip example
We have created three roles and ticked the correct permissions:

- **Chef** - He can enter, cook and manage the kitchen.
- **Manager** - He can enter and manage the kitchen, but does not have permissions to cook.
- **Customer** - He has no permissions to perform any of those actions.

With our policy defined, we can now add physical users that will serve a role. Once the permission is assigned to the specific person,
they will automatically aquire all the role's permissions.

:::tip example

- **John Smith** recieved the role of a **Chef**.
- **Jane Adams** is the manager of **John's Kitchen**.
- **Paul Roberts** is only a customer that came in to eat delicious pizza. He has no permissions.
