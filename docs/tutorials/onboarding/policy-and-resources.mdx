### Creating our resource

We will now go ahead and create our first **resource** that we want to protect.

A resource is the target object we want to authorize access too. We can also refer to them as the **_objects_** of
authorization queries.

:::tip example
**John's Pizza** has a **kitchen**, that only certain individuals have access too, and can only perform restricted actions in.

Unfortunately, defining just a resource is not enough. Each resource needs assigned actions that can be associated with it.

### Defining our actions

:::tip example
**John's Kitchen** will have three actions applied - the ability to **enter**, **cook** and **manage**.
