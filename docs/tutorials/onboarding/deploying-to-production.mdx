Ready to deploy to production ?

When deploying to production, you might want to work with a local PDP (A Policy-Decision-Point microservice) within your VPC.
The PDP is easy to install (`docker pull`), and will ensure **zero-latency, great performance, high availability, and improved security**.

To get started with your PDP, follow the instructions here.


## Installing the sidecar

Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub [(Click here to install Docker)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):
```sh
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

Run the container (replace the PDP_API_KEY environment variable with your API key):
```sh
docker run \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>} \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

## Using the sidecar

The sidecar will listen on port `7766` by default, so all you have to do is to set your PDP_URL in our SDK initialization to `http://localhost:7766` and you're good to go.

For example in Node.js:
```js
const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
  token: "<CLIENT_TOKEN>"
});
```
