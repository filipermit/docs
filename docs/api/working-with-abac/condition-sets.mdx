title: Condition Sets

Condition sets give you the flexibility of ABAC with the simplicity of RBAC.

:::info
Condition sets are sets of objects that represent logical elements in your system.
:::

There are currently **two types of condition sets** that you can work with:

1. **User Set** - defined as a set of users that match all the specified conditions.
2. **Resource Set** - defined as a set of resources that match all the specified conditions.

## Example of a User Set

:::tip US BASED EMPLOYEES
All users who are **located in the United States** and have the **role of an Employee**.

We will call this _**us_based_employees**_.
:::

## Example of a Resource Set

:::tip PRIVATE REPOSITORIES
All resources that are of the **type repository** and are **private**.

We will call this _**private_repos**_.
:::

We can then picture a matrix of assignment between user sets and resource sets. We placed a checkbox to indicate that **us_based_employees**
can perform **any action** on the **private_repos** resource.

|                          | Admin | Employee | Employee in the US |
| ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | :----------------: |
| **Private Repositories** |       |          |       **X**        |
| Marketing Materials      |       |          |                    |

## Creating a Condition Set

We will now view code examples of a condition set written for the above defined User and Resource Sets.

### User Set - US Based Employees

Notice how we want both conditions to be true, so we ended up using the **allOf** logical operator.

We have also specified the type of the condition set to be **userset**.

```javascript title="us_based_employees"
{
    "key": "us_based_employees",
    "name": "US based employees",
    "type": "userset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "user.role": {
                    "equals": "employee"
                }
            },
            {
                "user.location": {
                    "in": [
                        "US"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Resource Set - Private Repositories

In this example of a resource set condition, the type changed to **resourceset**.

```javascript title="private_repos"
{
    "key": "private_repositories",
    "name": "Private Repositories",
    "type": "resourceset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "resource.type": {
                    "equals": "repository"
                }
            },
            {
                "resource.access": {
                    "equals": [
                        "private"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

We have now successfully defined two condition sets. Let's learn how we can use them together and create a **[Condition Set Rule](condition-set-rules)**.


## Condition Set Hierarchy

Condition sets can have an optional **parent condition set**. A condition set with a parent applies all conditions from its parent in addition to its own conditions (logical AND). Condition Sets can have multiple levels of hierarchy, and the resulting conditon will apply rules from all of a Condition Set's parents.

Using the Condition Set created in the previous step, we will define a Condition Set for private repositories that have been archived.

```javascript title="private_archived_repos"
{
    "key": "private_archived_repos",
    "name": "Private Archived Repositories",
    "type": "resourceset",
    "parent_id": "private_repositories",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "resource.type": {
                    "equals": "repository"
                }
            },
            {
                "resource.archived": {
                    "equals": [
                        "true"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
