title: No matching resource sets found for the given user and attributes
---

You got this error because the user you are trying to check does not have any matching resource sets.
This means that the user attributes you are passing in the check or exists in permit DB do not match any of the resource sets you have created in the Permit web application.
You can see the resource sets you have created in the Permit web application in the [Policy management screen](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) and edit a resource set to review it's conditions.

### How to fix it

You can either send the correct user attributes or create a resource set that matches the user attributes you are sending.

#### Sending the correct user attributes

If you are storing the user attributes in Permit DB make sure this user has it.
you can check it on the [User management screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management) in the Permit web application.
or you can check it using the [Get user](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Users/operation/get_user) API call.

If you are sending the attributes in the permit.check verify you are sending the correct attributes.

#### Creating a resource set that matches the user attributes

You can create a resource set that matches the user attributes with [Policy management screen](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) in the Permit web application.
You can also create a resource set with the [Create resource set](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Condition-Sets) API call.
