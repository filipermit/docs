# Working with the FoAz UI

:::note
Before you will be able to configure new mapping rules for your frontend-only authorization, you will need to
**[fetch your JWKs](/foaz/fetching-jwks)** from your authentication provider and **[add the JWKs](/foaz/configuring-jwks)** to Permit.
:::

The FoAz UI is intuitive and easy to navigate, making the process of configuring new mapping rules for your frontend-only authorization
straightforward. You can access the UI inside the Permit App [here](https://app.permit.io/foaz-proxy).

Here is a visual representation of the FoAz UI for better understanding:

### Mapping Rules

The mapping rules feature in the FoAz UI links HTTP URLs to particular resources and actions within the Permit.io platform.
These rules are essential for controlling access and permissions on your website or application. Each rule defines the
association between an incoming HTTP request and the corresponding resource within your application that the request should
interact with.

By correctly setting up mapping rules, you can ensure that requests are correctly routed and that users only have access
to the resources that they are authorized to view or modify.

### Proxy Request URL

In FoAz UI, you can set variables as part of the URL using the following syntax: `{var1}`. This feature is called templating
the URL, and it's beneficial to reduce the overall number of mapping rules required.

For example, you might set up a URL like this: `example.com/v1/{customer_id}/payments`.

In this case, `{customer_id}` is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual customer ID during the request.
This strategy allows you to use a single mapping rule for all customers, rather than needing a separate rule for each customer.

### Secret configuration

The secret configuration is a critical part of the FoAz UI. It is where you provide the secret that can authenticate against
the service you're proxying, for instance, if you're proxying Stripe requests, you would set your Stripe secret here.

Once the secret is authorized, it will be passed as part of the modified HTTP request. The HTTP request will be adjusted
to include authentication details, enabling the request to access the required service securely and correctly.

This setup ensures the secure transmission of sensitive data and enables appropriate access control to your
integrated third-party services.

:::warning Remember
Safeguarding these secrets is critical. Always follow best practices to keep these secrets secure and
never expose them in places where unauthorized individuals might gain access.
