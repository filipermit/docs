# API Key Management

The API Keys screen allows you to create and manage API Keys to the Permit.io service.
With the API keys you create, you can issue requests to the Permit REST API.

To manage API keys, go to the **Settings screen** on the Sidebar and select the **API Keys** tab.

You will need an organization-level API key to manage your workspace, projects or environments via the API.

Click on "Create Key" in the Organization API Keys table and give a meaningful name to your key, so you make revoke it later if needed.
