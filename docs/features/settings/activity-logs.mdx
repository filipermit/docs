# Activity Log

The activity log screen shows the Permit.io internal audit log - **who did what** within your Permit.io workspace.
This log will only show changes made via the Permit.io dashboard.
If you wish to see changes made via the Permit.io REST API, you should check out the API log.

To view the activity log, go to the **Settings screen** on the Sidebar and select the **Activity Log** tab.


:::info
Only workspace owners may view activity logs. 

If you cannot see this screen, contact the workspace owner (typically the person who opened the account).
