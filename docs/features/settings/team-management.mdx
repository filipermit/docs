# Team management

The team management feature allows you to manage access to the Permit.io SaaS. Team members may be able to modify policies via the dashboard or via API.

To manage access to your workspace, go to the **Settings screen** on the Sidebar and select the **Members** tab.

You will be able to see who has access to the entire workspace, or just to specific projects:

## Invite team members to the Permit workspace

To invite a member:
1) Click on "Add Member"
2) Fill in your team member's email address (you may enter more than one email address, separated by commas)
3) Select the access level (the member's role in the Permit system)
4) Click on "Invite users"

## Invite team members to a specific project

You may invite team members only to a specific project or a specific environment (for example - only the dev environment).
In that way you can access who can modify the permissions to the production environment, or separate access to different projects.

To invite a member to a specific project, go to the projects screen and click on the members icon near the project name:

You can now invite members to this project, change roles or revoke access.

Limitations:
1) If you invited a member to the entire workspace, you cannot modify the role from the project screen.
2) if you are not a project or a workspace owner, you will not be able to manage project access.

## Invite team members to a specific environment

To invite a member to a specific environment, go to the projects screen and click on the members avatars inside the environment card:

You can now invite members to this environment, change roles or revoke access.
