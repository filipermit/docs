# User Management

Your end-users are probably the main reason you create your application.

Via the **[User Management](https://app.permit.io/user-management)** web interface you can control your **[users](/features/user-management#users)** -

- **create** new users
- **update** existing users
- **delete** users
- **assign** roles to each user
- **assign** users to **tenants**.

This is of course in addition to the API.

## Users

Users can represent both people and automated entities. Users are assigned to tenants (each user can belong to more than one tenant)
and can then be assigned roles and permissions.

The user's granted roles and permissions will decide what actions in your app will be allowed or denied for that user.

:::info
Users are **nested** under **tenants**. <br/>
**Each user** can be associated with **multiple tenants**.

_Each user has a **unique id** (not visible in the screenshot), thats composed of_ -

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Role

## Tenants

A tenant is a group of users that share a common organizational identity.
Usually, each tenant will represent one of the end-customer companies in your product (i.e. the company that you sell to).
With the tenant feature we enable you to have multi-tenancy straight out of the box.

Users are contained within tenants, and can only access the resources within their tenant.
:::info
You can use the same user-id within multiple tenants, so the user belongs to multiple tenants.
Tenants usually represent an end customer account (sometimes you'd use multiple tenants to represent sub groups for the same account).
::::

### Single Tenant Mode

You can pass a tenant identifier for every `permit.check()` call you perform,
but for cases where you have a single tenant, you can use the `tenant` parameter in the SDKs `init()` function to specify the
tenant to be used as a default.

:::tip
This can be useful in multi-tenancy scenarios, where you have a default global organization to which people belong to.
