# Multitenancy

## What is Multi-tenancy ?

At its core, multi-tenancy allows every part of the service (i.e., every microservice) to cater to multiple customers without deploying separate instances for each. <a href="https://www.permit.io/blog/multitenancy-in-cloud" target="_blank">

Most modern applications, especially microservices-based ones, require some degree of multi-tenancy.

There are advantages of using multi-tenancy:

- Allows a **secure and compliant** access separation.
- Allows the application to **serve multiple customers** at once - while sharing the underlying infrastructure and services.
- Allows for **load balancing** and **scaling**.

An authorization layer is the most robust and fastest way to **upgrade** from a single-tenant application to a multi-tenant
application **safely**. By applying a policy across all the relevant services, the authorization layer can apply the needed
separation without requiring changes to the services themselves.

## Tenants in Permit.io

Tenants in Permit.io are a first-class citizen; which means you get all the interfaces (UI, SDK, and API) to manage them out of the box.
Often a tenant would represent an end-customer of yours, but sometimes you'd want multiple tenants to represent a single logical customer tenant (for example if you have multiple departments within each logical tenant).
[Tenants are nested under environments](/features/projects-and-env#permit-object-model)

### Silos of Resources and Users

The easiest way to think about tenants is as **a silo of resources and users**; which in policy terms means **only users within a tenant can act on the resources within the tenant.**
Tenants are isolated from one another.

#### Assigning Users to Tenants

Users are [assigned to tenants via a role](https://api.permit.io/redoc#tag/Role-Assignments/operation/assign_role).

### Tenant Resources

To indicate a instance resource belongs to a tenant simply provide the tenant key (or id) as part of the resource object when calling permit.check().
NodeJS example (same concept applies in other languages):

```javascript
const permitted = await permit.check(userKey, "create", {
  type: "document", // The resource name
  tenant: tenantKey, // The tenant key
});
```

Resource types (as opposed to resource instances) are part of an environment, and not a specific tenant.

### Tenant APIs

- Manage Tenants - [Tenants API](https://api.permit.io/redoc#tag/Tenants)
- Assign a User to a Tenant - [Role-Assignments API](https://api.permit.io/redoc#tag/Role-Assignments/operation/assign_role)

### Tenant UI

The user-management interface includes tenant management; top left selector allows both switching tenants, editing their names, and creating new tenants.
