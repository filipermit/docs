# User Management Element

<span className="subtitle-custom">
	Effortlessly manage users and their permissions as a single secure, embeddable
	UI component.
</span>
<br />
<br />
The User Management Element is an embeddable UI component that lets you take control
of your whole team, and give other team members specific permissions levels that
reflect how they can manage other users on your team.

### Initializing Permit

<CodeDropdown
	number="1"
	title=""
	server
	code={[code.initialize_node, code.initialize_python, code.initialize_dotnet, code.initialize_java]}
	language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
	languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}
	open
>
	{/* If you are already using Permit, you can skip this step. */}
	In order to use Permit Elements, you need to be a **user of Permit**. When starting to use Permit, you will need to 
	initialize an instance of Permit in your backend logic. This **only needs to be done once**, both to use Permit and Elements.
	Please remember to copy your `SDK Secret Key` and pass it into the initialized Permit object.

</CodeDropdown>

### Server-side Login Route

You need to create a route in your backend server to allow your client to `loginAs` themselves and get access the Permit Element.

The backend `loginAs` route is matched based on the Authentication methods you have implemented inside your App. Most applications
authenticate with the **Bearer Token** or **Cookies**, but we also allows you to use any other **HTTP Security Header**. The important
part here is, that you use the appropriate code example below based on your Authentication method.

The `loginAs` function takes two parameters. You need to pass in the unique `userId` you get from your **JWT** (JSON Web Token),
and a `tenant_key` or `tenantId`.

```js
permit.elements.loginAs({ userId, tenant });
```

:::info IMPORTANT
The **user must belong to the tenant** that he will be logged into. If he is not, you will see a login error saying `USER_NOT_FOUND`.

If the user gets logged out, he also exits the current tenant specificed in the `loginAs` method. If you want to **change tenants** for
a user, you need to **log them out**, and **log them back in** to a different tenant.
:::

Passing in the tenant is **compulsory** when logging in a user **server-side**.

<CodeDropdown
	number="2.1"
	title="Using Cookies"
	server
	code={[
		code.cookies_node,
		code.cookies_python,
		code.cookies_dotnet,
		code.cookies_java,
	]}
	language={["javascript", "python", "c", "java"]}
	languages={["Node", "Python", "Dotnet", "Java"]}

	]}
	language={["frontendOnly"]}
	languages={["FrontendOnly"]}
>
	First open your Permit Dashboard and go to the **Elements** page. Then click
	on **Configure JWKS** on the upper left corner and add your JWKS to the
	dialog. Then paste your JWKS into the text dialog and click **OK**.
	_![Configure JWKS](/img/elements/configure-jwks.png)_ Now make sure that your
	Permit user key is the same as the jwt sub. You can see your permit user key
	in the **Users** page in the Permit Dashboard. You can see your jwt sub with
	sites like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). Just paste your jwt token into the text
	dialog check in the left side the sub field.
</CodeDropdown>

### Install Permit-js

Once you have your application ready, you need to install Permits's JS SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt embeddable Element components.

<CodeDropdown
	number="3"
	title=""
	client
	code={[code.npm, code.yarn]}
	showLineNumbers={false}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["npm", "yarn"]}
	open
>
	Add the Permit JavaScript SDK to you app:
</CodeDropdown>

### Client-side login method

This function should be called as early as possible in your App. This is best done inside a `App`/`index` file; **right after** the users
had just had their identity confirmed by the Authorization provider you are using, but **just before** the Embededd component is loaded.

With any of these login frontend methods, it's **optional** to pass in your **tenant key**, in comparison to the server-side call where **it
is required**. The server-side tenant will **always take precedence**. We do however encourage passing in the same tenant in your frontend
and backend login calls for best practices and for adding clarity to your code.

<CodeDropdown
    number="4"
    title=""
    client
    code={[code.elementLogin]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["Node"]}
    open
>
    This is the permit element object that is calling the backend route we have
    configured previously and logging in the user.

</CodeDropdown>

There are **four** things that need to be configured here:

1.  `loginUrl` - The url that corresponds to your backend login route you created in the last step.
2.  `loginMethod` - The login method you are using in your backend.
3.  `tenant` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method. the name of the tenant that the user is part of, you can set it at your backend as well, if you are using frontendOnly this is required.
4.  `token` (Optional) - Required for bearer token login method, you need to pass the token here.
5.  `headers` (Optional) - Required for custom headers login method, you need to pass the headers here.
6.  `userJwt` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the user jwt here.
7.  `envId` (Optional) - Required for frontendOnly login method, you need to pass the env id here.

There are **3 supported login options** choose the one that you are using in your backend.

<CodeDropdown
	number="4.1"
	title="Cookie Login Method"
	client
	code={[code.loginDefault]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
	open={false}
>
	The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.cookie`.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
	number="4.2"
	title="Bearer Token Login Method"
	client
	code={[code.loginHeaders]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
	open={false}
>
	The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.bearer`
	and the **token** should be set to the current user token.
</CodeDropdown>

<CodeDropdown
	number="4.3"
	title="Other Header Login Method"
	client
	code={[code.other_headers]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
	open={false}
>
	The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.header`
	and you should pass the **headers** to the current user auth headers.
</CodeDropdown>
<CodeDropdown
	number="4.4"
	title="FrontendOnly"
	client
	code={[
		code.frontendOnlyLogin
	]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["JS"]}
>
	The **loginMethod** here should be set to: `LoginMethod: LoginMethod.frontendOnly`
	**userJwt** should be set to the current user token.
	**tenant** should be set to the tenant you want to get access to, the current user must have role assigned to him in this tenant.  
	**envId** should be set to the environment id you want to get access to, you need to make sure you have set the JWKS in this env see step 2.4, you can get your env id with [this api call](https://api.permit.io/v2/docs#/Environments/list_environments).Or take it from the get code dialog in the Permit Elements Dashboard.  
	**userKeyClaim** (Optional) - Optional for frontendOnly login method, if your user key in Permit isn't the same as the jwt `sub` claim, you need to pass the key of the claim here.

</CodeDropdown>
After you run login successfully you will **get a cookie** called `permit_session` which will allow you to
load your Permit Element securly and successfully.

### Client-side logout method

This function should be called along with the logging-out logic that you have within your App, to make sure the user does not
continue to have access to the Permit Element.

<CodeDropdown
	number="5"
	title=""
	client
	code={[code.elementLogout]}
	language={["javascript"]}
	languages={["Node"]}
	open
>
	This logout method **should be called** as part of the logic of logging your
	user out with your authentication solution.
</CodeDropdown>

### Login Errors

There are a few possible errors you might find yourself come across while working with the embedding of Permit Elements.

| Error                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND`           | This error can appear if you are trying to log in as a particular user, but that **user does not exist within Permit**. You can also experience this login error when you are trying to login a user into a **tenant that he does not belong to**. |
| `TENANT_NOT_FOUND`         | This error can appear when you are passing in a tenant, either in the frontend `permit.elements.login` function, or in your backend URL endpoint, where the tenant has not been created in Permit.                                                 |
| `INVALID_PERMISSION_LEVEL` | This error will emerge when you are trying to access part of the Element which you have not been given access too. This usually means the role that the person obtained has remained in the **Hidden Roles** permission level.                     |
| `FORBIDDEN_ACCESS`         | This error will emerge when you are trying to login to an Element you have not been given permission to see.                                                                                                                                       |

## Customizing your Element

Each element offers customization and configuration.

### Match your brand

With every new element, you will be able to adjust several setting to make the look and feel of the element really your own.

<div className="list">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>
				Change the background and primary colour of any element to match your
				brand.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>
				Give the element a title that makes sense to your end user, or hide it
				fully.
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>
				Decide if you want to display your users Email, Full Name or both on the
				element.
			</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

### Configure your webhook

Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. They carry data in 'payloads', which are sent to a
unique URL, essentially a place where your API can accept data.

With some Permit Elements, you will get the option to configure a webhook to stay informed of the actions that are performed
by the end users.

_![Webhook](/img/elements/webhook.png)_

:::info EXAMPLE
The User Management Element's webhook provides an array of functionalities. For example, you can leverage it to receive
notifications each time a new user is created in your system, or to initiate the sending of a welcome message to recently
invited users.
:::

#### Setting Up the URL Endpoint

Before setting up a URL endpoint, it's important to note that the URL endpoint is the URL to which the webhook delivers data
each time an event occurs. This endpoint should be set up on your server or a third-party service, depending on your preference.

#### Choose Your Platform:

Decide whether you want to set up your endpoint on your own server or use a third-party service. If you're comfortable
managing a server and can handle potential scaling, security, and uptime issues, you may prefer to host it yourself.
Otherwise, consider using a third-party service, many of which handle these issues for you.

#### Create the Endpoint:

Create a new endpoint on your server or within your chosen third-party service. This is often a case of creating a new
URL route. For example, `/new-element-sure` or `/send-elements-email`.

#### Implement Webhook Handling:

Your endpoint needs to be able to receive POST requests, as webhooks will typically send data via this method. This
means your endpoint needs to be set up to read the payload from incoming POST requests and then process it as required.
This usually involves parsing JSON, although the exact format may vary.

#### Secure Your Endpoint:

Webhooks contain data, and you should ensure it's secure from potential malicious use. Within the Permit configuration screen,
we provide a input box so you can enter your secret, and use it to validate incoming data. This will ensure that the data is coming
from a trusted source. Also, ensure your endpoint uses HTTPS, encrypting data in transit.

_![Webhook](/img/elements/webhook-2.png)_

#### Respond to the Webhook:

After receiving a POST request, it's good practice to send a 200 HTTP status code to acknowledge receipt of
the data. If your endpoint fails to do this, the webhook may consider the delivery a failure and retry,
causing unnecessary traffic.

## Embedding the iFrame

After you finish configuring and customising your element, you are ready to it into your App. A code snippet for the element
will be generated for you.
This will be an `<iframe>` that you can insert anywhere into your website. It will look like the code snippet below.

```html
<iframe
	title="Permit Element Name"
	src="https://embed.permit.io/name?envId=<SOME_UNIQUE_ID>"
	width="100%"
	height="100%"
	style="border: none;"
/>
```
