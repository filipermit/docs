Writing and maintaining good authorization policies is hard.
The **[Policy Editor](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor)** plays a centric part into what we offer at Permit. It was
designed to take away the hassle of dealing with complex code, and offer a UI solution that allows both novice and
experienced users to create and edit authorization policies with ease - with code or low-code interfaces.

We combine the power of a powerful authorization engine with the ease of use of a simple web interface, making us a very desired
product withing many companies.

You can manage policies from the **[Policy Editor](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor)** page.

## What is a Policy?

A policy is a way of defining rules of how permissions are granted. Within each policy, we focus on a hierarchy view of how permissions are applied.

:::info
A policy consists of **user roles**, **actions**, and **resources**.
:::

:::info
A policy **resides** in an **environment**.
:::

There are two types of policies that we currently support. **[RBAC (Role-based Access Control)](RBAC/overview)** and **[ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control)](ABAC/overview)**.

## What makes up an RBAC Policy?

### Roles

Roles exist on an organization level - whether you change project, tenant, or environment, the same roles exist for you.
Roles are assigned to users in the **[User Management](/features/user-management)** page.

### Resources

Resources are tied to the selected environment. A resource is the target object we want to authorize access too.

### Actions

Actions are contained within each resource. They are what a person with a specific role can and cannot do.
They can be custom and accomodate only to one specific resource.

**Resources** and **Actions** are at the core of the Policy Editor and are defined in the editor within the **application's configuration** or **via the API**.
Once defined, resources and actions become the layout for permissions.

:::info
A **role** that is assigned (checkbox marked) to a resource and action allows users with that role to perform the action on a resource.
:::

_Above is a Policy Editor example with two roles (**Admin**, **Viewer**) and three resources (**task**, **boards**, **counts**)_
_The Admin can do everything except delete tasks._

## What makes up an ABAC Policy?

### User Sets

User Sets are groups of users that adhere to pre-defined attribute-based conditions. These are conditions based on individual
user characteristics.

### Resource Sets

Resource Sets are groups of resources that adhere to pre-defined attribute-based conditions. These are conditions based on
an environment a resource exists in (e.g. time and location).

## Authorization Models

Permit.io supports multiple authorization models - including **RBAC** (**_Role Based Access Control_**) and **ABAC** (**_Attribute Based Access Control_**).
By default the UI is set to work with RBAC & ABAC. Authorization models can always be extended with additional code.

## OPA Policies

By default, Permit.io uses the OpenPolicyAgent (OPA) and its code based policy language - which is **[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)** - to create and maintain authorization policies.
Rego code can be created by using the low-code Policy Editor UI, or by directly writing code.
Code created through the editor is merged into a Git repository (as part of the Permit.io cloud or one of your choice).
The stored policies are then deployed on the fly via **OPAL** to the multiple **PDP microservices** that you deploy.

## GitOps

We support Rego editing via the **GitOps Feature**, in which the policy editor commits the
**[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)** code you generate into a git
repository of your choice.

The GitOps feature allows you to **manage all your policies** within Git by **subscribing to a Git repository**, which will all be
tracked and deployed from there by OPAL. Git provides all the versioning.

As mentioned above - Policies created with the Policy Editor are merged into a Git repository, this allows us to create a
controlled process for creating and maintaining policies. Code-reviews, tests and approval flows combine easily with GitOps
and the Permit.io authorization development life cycle.

The feature is **not open to everyone** is self-service, however, **[email](mailto:support@permit.io)** us
or **[send us a message](https://bit.ly/permit-slack)** on **Slack**, and we will enable it for you.
