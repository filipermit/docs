## What makes up an RBAC Policy?

An **RBAC Policy** is the simplest policy that we can define. It's made up of **roles**, **resources** and **actions**.

The basic idea of RBAC is that any role can have the permissions to perform an action on any resource.

### Keyword Definitions

**Role** - the action and responsibilities that a particular person has.<br />
**Resource** - the target object we want to authorize access too.<br />
**Action** - the process of performing a certain task on a resource.

### Simple Example

One role-based access control example is a set of permissions that allow users to read, edit, or
delete articles in a writing application. There are two roles, a Writer and a Reader, and their respective
permission levels are presented in this truth table. Using this table, you can assign permissions to each user.

| Permission/Role | Writer | Reader |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Edit**        | Yes    | No     |
| **Delete**      | Yes    | No     |
| **Read**        | Yes    | Yes    |

:::tip
When creating an RBAC policy within the UI, every **resource** and **action** will get **inherited** by any other role
you decide to add.

Below is an example of a two roles; an Admin and a Friend - both with different permissions to view the details within the
**card** resource.
