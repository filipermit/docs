# Follow-along Example

There are several steps we want to consider when creating an ABAC Policy with the use of the UI.

Running through building this policy will be best with the aid of a simple example that we can follow.

:::info example
**Students at Stanford University who study full-time are the only ones that can rent University bicycles after 5pm.**
:::

## Create User Attributes

In order to create user attributes, we need to navigate to the **Users** panel. We click the **User Attributes** button, and we have the option to **add a new user attribute**.

![User Attribute Creation Window](/img/abac/user-attributes-0.png)

We can define and add attributes based on our example. In this case, we have two user attributes, the **university** a student attends, and
if the student **is-full-time**.

![Defined User Attributes Example](/img/abac/user-attributes-2.png)

Once we are happy with the definitions, we need to **save** the newly created user attributes.

## Create Tenant Attributes

Just like user attributes, in order to create tenant attributes, we need to navigate to the **Users** panel. We click the **Tenant Attributes** button, and have the option to **add a new tenant attribute**.

![Tenant Attribute Creation Window](/img/abac/tenant-attributes-0.png)

In this example , we have three tenant attributes, whether the tenant **is-paying**, its service **tier**, and how many
users the tenant is paying for.

![Defined Tenant Attributes Example](/img/abac/tenant-attributes-3.png)

Once we are happy with the definitions, we need to **save** the newly created user attributes.

## Define a User Set

Now that we have created our attributes, we can go ahead and define a user set. Within each user set, we can **add conditions** that will be applied
to each user.

![User Set Window](/img/abac/user-set.png)

A user set, as explained previously, is a set of condition groups that match specific characteristics of either **the user or its tenant**.
As per our above example, a user set for us is **Students at Stanford University who study full-time**.

![User Set Example](/img/abac/user-set-1.png)

This is a very simple example of a user set. You can create a user set with several condition groups and multiple conditions within each group.
If you would like to learn more about creating conditions, please refer to **[Available Operators](/api/working-with-abac/operators)**.

## Create a New Resource

A resource is what we will be assigning our actions too, and giving each user set the permissions to perform certain actions.
First, we have to create a new resource.

![Resource Window](/img/abac/resource-0.png)

As per our above example, our resource will be a **bicycle**, and because we are referring to a bicycle that can be rented out,
the attribute will be **time**.

![Resource Adding Attributes Example](/img/abac/resource-1.png)

We have given the resource two actions. A user is able to **ride** and **rent** a bicycle.

## Define a Resource Set

Now that we have set up our resource with specific characteristics, we can go onto defining a resource set.
Following in the footsteps of our defined example above, the condition that we will be building for our resource is
**renting University bicycles after 5pm**.

![Resource Set Window](/img/abac/resource-set-0.png)

Our conditions for this set will be setting **time** using the comparison **greater-than** to 5pm.

![Resource Set Example](/img/abac/resource-set-1.png)

## Apply Permissions to create an ABAC Policy

Now that we have set up all the attributes for users and resources, along with the user and resource set, we apply permissions
directly from the dashboard.

We have a **Full-Time Stanford Student** role, where a resource is **renting bicycles after 5pm**. It's as simple as ticking the right
option!

![Giving Permissions](/img/updated/abac/abac-stanford-1.png)

Remember to always save your changes!

![Saving Permissions](/img/updated/abac/abac-stanford-2.png)

Congratulations! You have set up your ABAC policy.

## UI supports Complexity

Conditions can be very complex and difficult, but all of that complexity is supported within the UI. Below is an example of what
the UI looks like when several condition groups with many conditions are required.
