# Loading data via ther API

Permit offers a beautiful API editor for deadling with structuring your policies, looking into audits, managing your
team members and so on. It's important not to forget that the whole no-code UI is fully API driven, meaning you can
automate any of the actions.

:::note
You can find the whole redoc referencing all the API functionality [here](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc).

In the meanwhile, let's look into some shortcuts that can be accomplished with the use of the API.

## Dynamically adding actions to every new resource in the same request

Add `default_resource_actions` to your env settings like this (note that you need to set the `permit_env_api_key`).

Here is the example code:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/:project_id/envs/:env_id' \
--header 'authority: api.permit.io' \
--header 'authorization: Bearer permit_env_api_key' \
--header 'origin: https://app.permit.io' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"settings":{"default_resource_actions":["read","write"]}}'
```
