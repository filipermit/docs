# Audit Logs

Knowing who has done what in your application is critical for multiple reasons, including security, compliance,
debugging and even just plain old monitoring. **[Audit Logs](https://app.permit.io/audit-log)** are a great way
to track **who did what**, **when they did it**, **why they had permissions** and/or **did not have permissions** to do so!

They are a useful tool both for you and your team as the maintainers of your application, but also your end-users,
who want to track their own usage and actions within the app.

## Automatic Generation

As Permit.io powers your application, you are getting **automatic audit logs**.

Enforcement points, along with resource and action definitions, and user/tenant configurations automatically come together
to generate the full picture needed for an audit log entry.

While the Permit web interface provides a dedicated page for viewing your audit logs, you can also **find them directly**
in your deployed PDP microservice (as they are written to its stdout/stderr, you can of course stream them directly into your logging platform) .

## Types of Audit Logs

There are two types of audit logs:

- **Basic audit logs** - these are the basic logs reflecting actions in regards to your policy rules.
- **Decision logs** - more in-depth logs reflecting "**why**" the policy engine made a decision.

## View Audit Logs

Navigate to the **[Audit Log](https://app.permit.io/audit-log)** page in the Permit dashboard.
